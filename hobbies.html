                <h2>FOOTBALL</h2>
                <p>To be honest, I'm obsessed with football. Since the 2013-14 season, 
                    I have been watching football for more than 10 years. I am a fan enough to watch games from the Mozambican 
                    league if I have a chance, not the replays after the game is over like some. My favorite team is Fenerbahçe, 
                    the player is Ronaldo and the picture is an illustration that I saw in my dreams :dd. Along with Fenerbahçe, 
                    I definitely support Qarabagh, which represents my country at the highest level in Europe.</p>

                <h2>GAMING</h2>
                <p>Although I don't have much time to play games lately, I enjoy playing games
                     a lot. especially playing games like PES, FİFA, Blur on play station with my friends is very interesting. 
                    Currently, the game I play the most is FİFA Mobile.</p>

                <h2>TRAVELLING</h2>
                <p>One of my biggest passions is discovering new places. I'm always thinking 
                    about where I can go in the places I've been. In connection with this, despite the fact that I am 18 years old, 
                    I was born in Azerbaijan, I was a university student in Lithuania, and I am currently doing Erasmus in Finland. 
                    In addition to these countries, I have visited Iran, Georgia, Turkey, Germany, Sweden, and Latvia.</p>
